# Scientific Context

The current lack of standardized practices and definitions in NLP systems hinders the progress of the field. Indeed, there is not always consensus on which evaluation methods are meaningful and fruitful, or which of their implementations are to be used with which parameters (eg. SacreBLEU, Post 2018).
In some cases, there is no general agreement on the very definition of a task.
This situation calls for work on **standardizing NLP practices**.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has just created a dedicated working group on NLP (as a joint effort of the AI and Language committees), and 2 standards are already under way. Topics under consideration by the ISO standardization committees include NLP terminology, evaluation metrics, interoperability, annotation guidelines, good practices in NLP development/evaluation/corpora, documentation.

These topics are already heavily discussed in academia, and a number of informal guidelines have already been proposed. We believe that the creation of NLP standards can significantly benefit from the input of both NLP academics and industry NLP practitioners.
Reciprocally, NLP researchers would benefit from getting involved in the standardization effort, thus ensuring that academia's views are listened to, in particular in the context of the AI Act (the European regulation on AI that has been finalized in December), whose enforcement will strongly rely on those standards.

The objective of the STAND workshop is

- to foster discussion on existing standards, their creation and use
- to assess the current needs of the community for standardization
- to share experience on the impact on the research activities when lacking good practices
- to collect existing good practices (and propose new ones)

We invite contributions from NLP practitioners from both the industry and academia, as well as standardization experts.

# Program

### January 29: STAND workshop

- [09:00-10:00] Welcome, introduction to standardization, ongoing activities in NLP standardization, and the AI Act context
- [10:15-11:50] Academic keynote (Joakim Nivre) and invited talks (Matt Post, speaker TBC)
- [11:50-13:30] Poster session (with boosters) & lunch
- [13:30-14:40] Industry keynote (speaker TBC) and invited talk (Dirk Hovy)
- [15:00-16:30] Moderator-led breakout discussions. Potential topics that will be discussed include:
    - [sharing / drafting] Standardizing good practices for evaluation
    - [sharing / drafting] Standardizing good practices for corpus management (collection, annotation, versioning)
    - [sharing / drafting] Standardizing evaluation metrics (definitions, implementation, sharing scripts)
    - [sharing / drafting] Standardizing annotation schemes (formats and guidelines)
    - [debate] Explainability and ethics in NLP: what needs for standards?
    - [debate] Comparing standardization needs with limitations of the state-of-the-art: how to bridge the gap?
    - [debate] Towards standardizing translations of technical terminology in NLP: how to organize i18n?
- [16:30-17:30] Reports from breakouts, definition of community-level actions & wrap-up. Example outcomes that are envisioned include:
    - Collection and drafting of existing good practices
    - Preparation of a joint submission for a position paper
    - Creation of common repositories for evaluation scripts, corpus documentation

An informal dinner will be organized with participants staying overnight.

### January 30: all-day meeting of the European AI standardization committee about NLP standardization

Workshop participants are invited to stay to contribute any insight. The outputs of that meeting will be used in direct support of the EU AI Act, according to the European Commission's mandate.
